## BTI425 Week 2 Notes

The theme for the next week or more is to continue to expand upon our client-side, browser-based development skills, by introducing long-established libraries such as Lodash and Moment.js.  However, we will start with a very short review of the jQuery JavaScript library, focusing specifically on DOM Manipulation and working with some of the Bootstrap.  For a detailed review of the Bootstrap 3 framework, please refer to the extremely comprehensive (and well written) official [Bootstrap 3 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/)

**Topics:**

* Short [jQuery with Bootstrap Review](jquery-bootstrap-review.md)

* Helpful Utility Functions with [Lodash](lodash.md)

* Handling Date/Time information using [Moment.js](moment.md)
