## BTI425 Week 6 Notes

Starting this week, we will shift focus to Angular.

Like React, it all starts with *components*. The app is composed of a hierarchy of nested or contained components, and each encapsulates its visible content and appearance, its interaction code, and interfaces to other components and services. This is arguably the most important concept in Angular. 

We will begin by getting the tooling in place (provided by [*ng*](https://cli.angular.io/)) and looking at / dissecting the default app.  We will then take a look at how components are created as well as how templates are implemented and used to render data / respond to user events.

**Topics:**

* [Introduction to Angular](angular-intro)

* [Getting started by running the Default App](angular-get-started)

* [Introduction to Angular Components and Templates](angular-components-1)
