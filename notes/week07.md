## BTI425 Week 7 Notes

This week we will continue or discussion of Angular components by focusing on "attribute" binding, "directives" and "emitting events". The code discussed here will help to round out our discussion of how data is rendered using templates in Angular.  Additionally, we will discuss how we can wire up our components to use the [@Output()](https://angular.io/api/core/Output) decorator to emit custom events.  

Finally, we will introduce a simple routing configuration in an Angular application.


**Topics:**

* [Attribute, Class, Style Bindings & Directives](angular-attributes-directives)

* [Emitting Events](angular-events)

* [Introduction to Routing](angular-routing)
