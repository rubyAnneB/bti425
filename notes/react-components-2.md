## Putting it All Together

For this next section, we will be walking through the **[Week 4 Example](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425/tree/master/Code%20Examples/week4)**.
The following instructions are here to help get us started, as well as to provide guidance for installing dependencies, styles, 3rd party components, routes, etc.

### New App - my-app

To begin, create a new app as usual:

```terminal
create-react-app my-app
```

<br>

### Dependencies

Once this is complete, we must change to the newly created "my-app" directory and install the following packages from npm (npm install ...).

* `react-router-dom` - (Enable client-side routing in the browser)

* `react-bootstrap@0.33.1` (Include the Bootstrap 3 Components for React)

* `react-router-bootstrap` (Integration between React Bootstrap &amp; React Router v4, primairly the "LinkContainer" Component )

<br>

### CSS

#### App.css

The example does not make use of any of the **App.css** code included with the new app, so we can go ahead and **remove all of the content** included and replace it with the following single entry:

```css
span.navbar-brand:hover{
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

#### index.css

Similarly, we can **wipe out** all CSS in the **index.css** file.  

#### Bootstrap 3 CSS

Lastly, since we're working with the Bootstrap 3 Components for react (react-bootstrap@0.33.1), we must explicitly add the included CSS in our **public/index.html** file before the "manifest":

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-HSMxcRTRxnN+Bdg0JdbxYKrThecOKuH5zCYotlSAcp1+c8xmyTe9GYg1l9a69psu" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

<br>

### NavBar

The Week 4 example uses the following navbar consisting of the custom components installed using npm (above).  This navbar is placed above the (soon to be added) &lt;Switch&gt;&lt;/Switch&gt; element in *App.js*

```jsx
<Navbar inverse collapseOnSelect fixedTop>
  <Navbar.Header>
    <LinkContainer to="/">
      <Navbar.Brand>
        BTI425 - React Routing
      </Navbar.Brand>
    </LinkContainer>
    <Navbar.Toggle />
  </Navbar.Header>
  <Navbar.Collapse>
    <Nav>
      <LinkContainer to="/Products">
        <NavItem eventKey={1}>Products</NavItem>
      </LinkContainer>
      <LinkContainer to="/About">
        <NavItem eventKey={2}>About</NavItem>
      </LinkContainer>
    </Nav>
  </Navbar.Collapse>
</Navbar>
```

<br>

### Container, Routes & Components

All routes in the example code are defined using a &lt;Switch&gt;&lt;/Switch&gt; element in *App.js*.  Immediately surrounding this component (below the Navbar), we need to add the bootstrap 3 "container", "row" and "col-md-12" classes for &lt;div&gt; elements, ie:

```jsx
<div className="container">
  <div className="row">
    <div className="col-md-12">
      <Switch>
        ...
      </Switch>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Routes & Components

The example uses 4 components: 

* **&lt;Products /&gt;**: Renders a collection of elements in a table, where each row is a link to a specific element 

* **&lt;Product id={id value from route} /&gt;**: Renders the details of a specific element

* **&lt;About /&gt;**: Simple component that renders [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) Text

* **&lt;NotFound /&gt;**: Renders a "Not Found" message as well as a link that redirects the user back to the "/" route

They can be accessed using the routes:

* "/" - Redirects to **&lt;Products /&gt;**

* "/Products" - Renders **&lt;Products /&gt;**

* "/Product/:id "- Renders **&lt;Product id={id value from route} /&gt;**

* "/About" - Renders **&lt;About /&gt;**

* "(Not Found)" - Renders **&lt;NotFound /&gt;**

<br>

### Data Source

Finally, the data source used in the example is provided by [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/).  Specifically, it's the routes:

* GET [https://reqres.in/api/unknown](https://reqres.in/api/unknown) - for a list of products ("data")
* GET [https://reqres.in/api/unknown/n](https://reqres.in/api/unknown/n) - for a single product ("data") where "n" is the "id" value.
